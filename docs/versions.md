    - [ ] Linked list
    - [ ] Heap
    - [ ] Binary Search Tree

## v1.0.0 ‚Äî Uni Project

Final version of the *data structures* university project.

### Data structures

- Dynamic array (C++)
- Linked list (C++)
- Heap (C++)
- Binary Search Tree (C++)

### Benchmarking

- Benchmarks for all implemented DSes. Those benchmarks perform time complexity measurements for following operations:
    - Adding elements from various positions
    - Deleting elements from various positions
    - Searching for value
