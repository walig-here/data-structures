# ⚙️ Data structures v2

Personal project for in-depth learning and exploring the most important data structures in computer science. Why? Because practice makes perfect! Especially when practising the fundamentals 😉

Also it's a great way to find out how much I've improved in my coding skills over the years since the project's built upon my old university assignment from *Wrocław University of Science and Technology* where I implemented (in *C++*) and then measured time complexities of 3 basic data structures: **dynamic array**, **linked list**, **heap** and finally **binary search tree**.

## 🎯 Goals

- [ ] 👨🏻‍💻 Implement various data structures in low-level language (C++).

- [ ] ⏱️ Measure time & memory complexities of the implemented data structures & compare them to their equivalents from STL and higher-level languages: *Python*, *Java* and *TypeScript*.

- [ ] 📚 Dive into source code of these data structures in higher level languages to gain more in-depth understanding of those languages.

- [ ] 🖼️ App with visualizations for implemented data structures that would allow users to follow how they work step by step.
